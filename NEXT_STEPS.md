# 🚀 Complete CI/CD Pipeline Setup - Next Steps

## Current Status ✅

Your repository structure is ready for CI/CD! Here's what was created:

- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow files (placeholders)
- ✅ Directory structure for MLOps pipeline
- ✅ GitHub secrets setup guide
- ✅ Documentation and instructions

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. 🔄 Replace Workflow Placeholders

The workflow files created are placeholders. Replace them with the actual workflow content:

**Replace these files in `.github/workflows/`:**

1. **training-pipeline.yml** → Copy "GitHub Actions - Training Pipeline Workflow" artifact
2. **deployment.yml** → Copy "GitHub Actions - Deployment Workflow" artifact  
3. **testing-quality.yml** → Copy "GitHub Actions - Testing and Quality Workflow" artifact
4. **monitoring.yml** → Copy "GitHub Actions - Monitoring Workflow" artifact

### 2. 🔐 Set Up GitHub Secrets

**CRITICAL**: Add these secrets to your GitHub repository:

1. Go to: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mlops_production/settings/secrets/actions
2. Add `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` (your AWS access key)
3. Add `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` (your AWS secret key)

See `SECRETS_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions.

### 3. 📄 Copy Your Existing Scripts

Copy your working scripts to the `scripts/` directory:

```bash
# Copy your existing scripts
cp /path/to/your/preprocess_data.py scripts/
cp /path/to/your/train_model_dvc.py scripts/
cp /path/to/your/evaluate_model.py scripts/
cp /path/to/your/deploy_model_working.py scripts/
```

### 4. 📊 Copy DVC Configuration

Copy your existing DVC files:

```bash
# Copy DVC pipeline configuration
cp /path/to/your/dvc.yaml .
cp /path/to/your/params.yaml .

# Copy DVC directory (if different location)
cp -r /path/to/your/.dvc .
```

### 5. 🧪 Test the Pipeline

After completing steps 1-4:

```bash
# Stage all changes
git add .

# Commit the complete setup
git commit -m "Complete CI/CD pipeline setup with workflows"

# Push to trigger the pipeline
git push origin main
```

### 6. 📊 Monitor Results

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click the **Actions** tab
3. Watch the workflows execute
4. Check for any errors in the logs
5. Verify successful completion

## Expected Workflow Behavior

### 🤖 Training Pipeline
- **Triggers**: Push to main, PR creation, manual dispatch
- **Actions**: 
  - Pulls data from DVC
  - Runs preprocessing → training → evaluation
  - Validates model performance
  - Registers model in MLflow
  - Pushes artifacts to S3

### 🚀 Deployment Pipeline
- **Triggers**: After successful training, manual dispatch
- **Actions**:
  - Validates model meets criteria
  - Deploys to staging automatically
  - Requires manual approval for production
  - Runs health checks and validation

### 🧪 Testing Pipeline
- **Triggers**: Every push/PR, scheduled daily
- **Actions**:
  - Code quality checks (Black, flake8, isort)
  - Unit tests and integration tests
  - Security scanning
  - Performance tests

### 📊 Monitoring Pipeline
- **Triggers**: Every 6 hours, manual dispatch
- **Actions**:
  - Checks MLflow server health
  - Monitors model performance
  - Detects data drift
  - Sends alerts for issues

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Secrets not working**
   - Verify secret names match exactly
   - Check AWS credentials are valid
   - Ensure proper AWS permissions

2. **Workflows not triggering**
   - Check trigger conditions in workflow files
   - Verify branch names (main vs master)
   - Check file paths in trigger conditions

3. **DVC errors**
   - Verify DVC remote is configured
   - Check S3 bucket permissions
   - Ensure data files exist

4. **MLflow connection issues**
   - Verify MLflow server URL is accessible
   - Check network connectivity
   - Validate tracking URI format

## Success Criteria

When everything is working, you'll have:

- 🔄 Automatic training triggered by code changes
- 🚀 Automated deployment with proper gates
- 🧪 Continuous testing and quality assurance
- 📊 24/7 monitoring and alerting
- 📈 Complete MLOps workflow automation

## Next Phase: Production Optimization

After CI/CD is working:

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize model training time
   - Implement caching strategies
   - Parallel processing for large datasets

2. **Advanced Monitoring**
   - Custom metrics and dashboards
   - Real-time alerting systems
   - Data drift detection refinement

3. **Security Hardening**
   - Implement secret rotation
   - Add compliance checks
   - Security scanning automation

4. **Documentation**
   - API documentation generation
   - Runbook creation
   - Knowledge base development
